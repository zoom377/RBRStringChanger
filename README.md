# RBRStringChanger

This C++ program replaces the car name strings in RichardBurnsRally_SSE.exe with new ones from \Cars\Cars.ini so that the actual modded car names are displayed in-game. It is intended to work with RBRCIT.

The original size of RichardBurnsRally_SSE.exe is maintained and the strings are kept the same length as the originals(This means sometimes the last part of a car name is cut off).
If it can't find the car names it will replace the defaults.

How to use:
1. Backup RichardBurnsRally_SSE.exe just in case!
2. Place RBRStringChanger.exe in RBR directory
3. Make sure RichardBurnsRally_SSE.exe is not read-only
4. Run RBRStringChanger.exe after every time that you install new cars from RBRCIT.
